🎓 Student Performance Predictor
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict students’ math scores based on multiple input features like reading scores, writing scores, parental education, test preparation course, etc.

📌 Problem Statement
To predict students' math scores based on attributes such as:

Gender

Race/Ethnicity

Parental level of education

Lunch type

Test preparation course

Reading and Writing scores

🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline
The project is structured into the following stages:

1. 📥 Data Ingestion
Reads training and testing CSV files

Stores them in a structured directory

2. 🔄 Data Transformation
Handles missing values using SimpleImputer

Encodes categorical columns using OneHotEncoder

Scales features with StandardScaler

Saves the preprocessing object

3. 📊 Model Training
Trains multiple regressors (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, etc.)

Evaluates with R² score

Saves the best-performing model

4. 🚀 Deployment
Uses a Flask web app (app.py) for user interface

Takes user inputs and predicts math score
